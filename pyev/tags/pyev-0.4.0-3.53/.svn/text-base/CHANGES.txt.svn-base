0.4.0, changes since 0.1.1:

  misc:
  - Pyev now embeds libev. The modifications to libev are really trivial,
    in fact pyev should work with an unpatched libev. The patch applied to libev
    is included in the source distribution for documentation.
  - Better documentation overall (at least I think).
  - Pyev is now published under a dual bsd/gpl scheme.

  module:
  - The module is (correctly) named pyev, not ev.
  - Added EV_MINPRI, EV_MAXPRI const.
  - Function pyev.version() has been renamed pyev.abi_version(), pyev.version()
    now returns version strings for pyev and the underlying libev.

  Loop:
  - Methods backend() and is_default_loop() have been removed. They are replaced
    by attributes 'backend' and 'default_loop' respectively.
  - Method loop() now raises the last exception (if necessary) when returning.
  - There are now two cases where the loop will unloop itself on error, both are
    related to out of memory corner cases (sees Stat and Periodic).
  - New method now_update() (from libev ev_now_update).
  - New method verify() (from libev ev_loop_verify). Only present in debug
    builds (NDEBUG undefined or EV_VERIFY defined and greater than 0).

  watchers (common):
  - Methods is_active() and is_pending() have been removed. They are replaced
    by attributes 'active' and 'pending' respectively.
  - The 'callback' argument is now mandatory and cannot be None (except for
    Embed which accept None as 'callback').

  Io:
  - 'fd' argument can be either a python int, file object or socket objet (in
    fact it can be any python object having a fileno() method returning a
    valid system fd).

  Periodic:
  - Attribute 'at' has been removed. It is replaced by method at().
  - If 'reschedule_cb' raises an error and pyev runs out of memory handling it,
    the loop will unloop itself.

  Child:
  - Argument 'trace' is required to be a boolean.

  Stat:
  - Statdata attributes 'attr' and 'prev' are not generated on the fly anymore.
    Instead the attributes are updated when you start the watcher, when you call
    stat() and just before your callback is invoked. The last case introduce the
    possibility of running out of memory while creating the new 'attr' attribute,
    if that happens the loop will unloop itself.

  Async:
  - New attribute 'sent' (from libev ev_async_pending).
