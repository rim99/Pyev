Todo
====

* make a unittest test suite out of my local ones
* provide meaningful examples of use
* support win32?



Release 0.6.0-4.00
==================


:class:`~pyev.Loop`:

- Issue #10: Added debug parameter/attribute.
- Added io_interval and timeout_interval parameters.
- Methods pending_count() and depth() are replaced by attributes with the same
  names.
- Method count() is replaced by attribute iteration.



Release 0.5.3-3.8
=================

misc:

- better gc support (should fix circular reference cases).


:class:`~pyev.Watcher`:

- Issue #6: on Python 2 the priority attribute was supposed to be an int but
  accepted only longs.
- Unloop the loop and raise if EV_ERROR is received in callback.
- Issue #7: fix memory leak in callback.


:class:`~pyev.Periodic`:

- fix memory leak in reschedule callback.



Release 0.5.0-3.8
=================

misc:

- Bumped libev to pristine 3.8.
- pyev now works with Python 2 (>= 2.6.2) and Python 3 (>= 3.1.1).


:mod:`pyev`:

- Minor fixes in module init code (there was memory leaks in case of error).
- Added EVFLAG_NOINOTIFY, EVFLAG_NOSIGFD constants.
- Added EV_IO, EV_TIMER, EV_CUSTOM constants.


:class:`~pyev.Loop`:

- New method depth() (from libev ev_loop_depth).
- New methods suspend()/resume() (from libev ev_suspend/ev_resume).
- Added a data attribute.
- New methods pending_invoke()/pending_count() (from libev ev_invoke_pending/
  ev_pending_count).
- Added a pending_cb attribute.
- Change verify() so that it is always present (and stick to libev EV_VERIFY
  default value if not in a debug build).


:class:`~pyev.Timer`:

- New method remaining() (from libev ev_timer_remaining).


:class:`~pyev.Signal`:

- No need for a default loop anymore.


:class:`~pyev.Periodic`:

- If 'reschedule_cb' raises an error and pyev runs out of memory handling it,
  the program will abort.



Release 0.4.0-3.53
==================

misc:

- pyev now embeds libev. The modifications to libev are really trivial, in fact
  pyev should work with an unpatched libev. The patch applied to libev is
  included in the source distribution for documentation.
- Better documentation overall (at least I think).
- pyev is now published under a dual bsd/gpl scheme.


:mod:`pyev`:

- The module is (correctly) named pyev, not ev.
- Added EV_MINPRI, EV_MAXPRI constants.
- Function pyev.version() has been renamed pyev.abi_version(), pyev.version()
  now returns version strings for pyev and the underlying libev.


:class:`~pyev.Loop`:

- Methods backend() and is_default_loop() have been removed. They are replaced
  by attributes 'backend' and 'default_loop' respectively.
- Method loop() now raises the last exception (if necessary) when returning.
- There are now two cases where the loop will unloop itself on error, both are
  related to out of memory corner cases (sees Stat and Periodic).
- New method now_update() (from libev ev_now_update).
- New method verify() (from libev ev_loop_verify). Only present in debug
  builds (NDEBUG undefined or EV_VERIFY defined and greater than 0).


:class:`~pyev.Watcher`:

- Methods is_active() and is_pending() have been removed. They are replaced
  by attributes 'active' and 'pending' respectively.
- The 'callback' argument is now mandatory and cannot be None (except for
  Embed which accept None as 'callback').


:class:`~pyev.Io`:

- 'fd' argument can be either a python int, file object or socket objet (in
  fact it can be any python object having a fileno() method returning a
  valid system fd).


:class:`~pyev.Periodic`:

- Attribute 'at' has been removed. It is replaced by method at().
- If 'reschedule_cb' raises an error and pyev runs out of memory handling it,
  the loop will unloop itself.


:class:`~pyev.Child`:

- Argument 'trace' is required to be a boolean.


:class:`~pyev.Stat`:

- Statdata attributes 'attr' and 'prev' are not generated on the fly anymore.
  Instead the attributes are updated when you start the watcher, when you call
  stat() and just before your callback is invoked. The last case introduce the
  possibility of running out of memory while creating the new 'attr' attribute,
  if that happens the loop will unloop itself.


:class:`~pyev.Async`:

- New attribute 'sent' (from libev ev_async_pending).



Release 0.1.1
=============

First public release.
